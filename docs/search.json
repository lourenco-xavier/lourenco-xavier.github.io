I am a current candidate for a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Economics, with a minor in Data Science. I am tremendously passionate about statistical storytelling, numbers, and good food. You can often find me reading the news, strolling around, and studying. Outside of my main occupation, I am an avid cook, and I love learning history and geography.\nThe lovely being to your left is none other than Tininha, my family’s cat."
