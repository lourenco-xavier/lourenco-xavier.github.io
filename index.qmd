# Hello there.

Welcome to my personal website.

My name is Lourenço Xavier (pronounced Low-rén-sso Shaviér). I am a current candidate for a bachelor’s degree in **Mathematics** and **Economics**, with a minor in **Data Science**. I am tremendously passionate about **statistical storytelling**, numbers, and good food. You can often find me reading the news, strolling around, and studying. Outside of my main occupation, I am an **avid** cook, and I love **learning** history and geography.

The lovely being to your left is none other than Tininha, my family's cat.
